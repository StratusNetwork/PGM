Maps
====

The maps provided in this folder are "classic" maps that were developed during the early days of `oc.tc`. They are provided with the *sole* purpose of allowing contributors to easily test their changes without developing a new map. This is **not** an exhaustive list of maps and only severe bug fixes will be accepted, no additions or further changes.

Moreover, the maps and their associated files are **not** included under the project `LICENSE`. Therefore, [all rights are reserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved) by the authors of each of these maps. Authors who wish to revoke their map may submit an issue and their request will be fulfilled.
